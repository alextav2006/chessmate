# ChessMate: Introduction
ChessMate, fully designed and developed by me, is a chess game built in GDScript using the Godot Engine.

# Gameplay experience
Developed entirely in **GDScript** using the **Godot Engine**, ChessMate features an intuitive and minimalist UI **(User Interface)** combined with a smooth and friendly UX **(User Experience)**, delivering a unique **pixel-art style** and memorable gameplay experience.

# Features
**Comprehensive chess rules implementation:**
Includes all standard chess mechanics such as **check**, **checkmate**, **stalemate**, **legal moves validation** and **pawn promotion**. I'm looking forward to the implementation of **castling** and **en passant**.
