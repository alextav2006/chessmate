# ChessMate: Introduction
ChessMate is a chess game fully designed and developed by me using GDScript in the Godot Engine.

# Gameplay experience
Developed entirely in **GDScript** using the **Godot Engine**, ChessMate features an intuitive and minimalist UI **(User Interface)** combined with a smooth and friendly UX **(User Experience)**, delivering a memorable gameplay experience with a unique **pixel-art style**.

# Features
**Comprehensive chess rules implementation:**
Includes all standard chess mechanics such as **check**, **checkmate**, **stalemate**, **legal moves validation** and **pawn promotion**. Support for **castling** and **en passant** is currently under development.

**Turn-based logic & move highlighting:**
**Visual indicators for legal moves**, designed to assist beginners while remaining fast and fluid for experienced players.

**Pixel-art inspired UI:**
Clean and minimalist **design with pixel-art** aesthetics for a nostalgic yet modern look.

**Fully built with GDScript:**
All mechanics, systems, and UI programmed from scratch using GDScript in Godot Engine.

# Development challenges
Everything was straightforward to implement until I reached the integration of **legal move highlights**, which introduced a new level of complexity due to the interaction between **turn logic**, **board state updates**, and **special rule conditions**.

# What I learned
Developing ChessMate helped me consolidate **my skills** in **game logic**, **state management**, and **rule-based systems**. I gained hands-on experience **structuring gameplay mechanics** using GDScript in the Godot Engine, and learned how to design clean, modular code for turn-based logic.

The most **challenging part** was **implementing legal move validation and piece highlighting**, which required synchronizing game state, move legality, and UI feedback in real time.

This project also improved my ability to **debug complex interactions**, work with 2D arrays, and design user-friendly interfaces from scratch.

# Tech Stack
- **Language:** GDScript
- **Engine:** Godot Engine (2D)
- **UI Design:** Custom-built using Godot nodes (Control, etc.)
- **Data Structures:** 2D arrays, dictionaries for board state
- **Tools:** GIMP, Godot editor, Git for version control
